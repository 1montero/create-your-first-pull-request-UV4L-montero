Expectations 

- I expect to gain new knowledge in this course that would help me in my career. The journey in learning CMSC 100 will for sure be challenging, but I know it will be fruitful as long as I work hard and do my best.

- I definitely agree with what my partner stated, I also expect for this course to be fruitful for our future career. Moreover, without a doubt, this course will also really be challenging for me since I don't have that much background regarding web applicatoins. However, I'll alaso do my best and work hard in order to survive this course with flying colors
